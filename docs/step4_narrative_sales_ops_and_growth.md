# Step 4 – Narrative for Head of Sales Operations & Head of Growth

## Executive Summary

Our goal was to understand how each marketing channel performs across the full GTM funnel—from ad spend and web engagement down to revenue. Using the provided datasets (ad spend, web analytics, and Salesforce opportunities), we built a unified channel-level view of performance.

While the data is directional rather than fully attributable at the user level, the resulting model highlights clear patterns in efficiency, funnel conversion, and revenue impact across channels.

Below are the key insights most relevant to Growth and Sales Operations.

## Key Insights

### 1. Not all channels contribute equally across the funnel
Some channels perform well at the top (impressions/clicks) but do not translate effectively into conversions or pipeline. Others drive lower volume but higher-quality opportunities.

Understanding the “volume vs. quality” tradeoff at the channel level is essential for budget allocation.

---

### 2. Conversion efficiency varies meaningfully by channel
Across channels, we observed different strengths:

- **High-intent channels** tended to show strong session→conversion performance.  
- **Awareness channels** produced volume but weaker downstream conversion.

This suggests tailoring expectations and measurement by channel type rather than holding all channels to the same KPI standards.

---

### 3. Revenue contribution is more concentrated than spend
When comparing channel spend to Closed Won revenue, a few channels emerge as disproportionately strong contributors to the business.

This indicates an opportunity to shift budget toward channels demonstrating both efficiency and revenue predictability.

---

### 4. Full-funnel alignment exposes bottlenecks
By mapping performance across:
- ad engagement  
- site engagement  
- conversions  
- opportunity creation  
- revenue  

…we can see where channels fall off. In several cases, channels with decent conversion performance still underperform on opportunity creation, signaling a downstream qualification or intent gap.

These bottlenecks should inform both marketing investment decisions and Sales handoff strategies.

## Recommendations

### 1. Rebalance spend toward channels that show strong mid-funnel and lower-funnel performance  
Channels that consistently create opportunities and revenue should receive priority in the next budget cycle.

### 2. Treat channels differently based on role (awareness, consideration, intent)  
This ensures KPIs are realistic and aligned with how buyers behave on those channels.

### 3. Establish a shared funnel view across Growth and Sales Ops  
This model can serve as a foundation for ongoing reporting. A unified set of definitions will reduce friction between teams and focus discussions on outcomes rather than data reconciliation.

### 4. Continue improving attribution  
With additional identifiers (campaign_id, user_id, lead/contact IDs), we can evolve this model from channel-level aggregation into a true multi-touch attribution system.

## Closing

This unified funnel provides a high-level, directional view of how marketing activities ultimately drive pipeline and revenue. With more granular data and attribution paths, we can evolve this into a powerful operational asset for both Growth and Sales leadership.
