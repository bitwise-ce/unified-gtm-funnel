# Step 2 – Dimensional Model Diagram & Metric Definitions

## Overview
This section outlines the dimensional model used in the project and provides clear definitions for each core metric included in the final channel-level funnel table.

The goal is to create a structure that is:
- easy to interpret,
- aligned with typical analytics engineering patterns,
- appropriate for the constraints of the sample datasets (no user-level join keys),
- optimized for funnel-style reporting.
